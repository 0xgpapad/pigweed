# Pigweed embedded oriented software libraries

Pigweed is a collection of embedded-focused libraries, which we call "modules".
These modules are designed for small-footprint MMU-less microcontrollers like
the ST Micro STM32L452 or the Nordic NRF82832. The modules are designed to
facilitate easy integration into existing codebases.

Pigweed is in the early stages of development.
