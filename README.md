# Pigweed

Pigweed is an open source collection of embedded-targeted libraries--or as we
like to call them, modules. These modules are building blocks and infrastructure
that enable faster and more reliable development on small-footprint MMU-less
32-bit microcontrollers like the STMicroelectronics STM32L452 or the Nordic
nRF52832.

Pigweed is in the early stages of development, and should be considered
experimental. Weâ€™re continuing to evolve the platform and add new modules. We
value developer feedback along the way.

Pigweed is an open source project with a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
that we expect everyone who interacts with the project to respect.

# Getting Started

If you'd like to get set up with Pigweed, please visit the
[setup guide](docs/setup.md), and then check out the
[Pigweed developer's guide](docs/developer_guide.md) for more information on how
to get the most out of Pigweed.
