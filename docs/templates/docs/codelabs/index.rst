Codelabs
========
..
  Codelabs are tutorials that are primarily learning-oriented; they are designed
  to teach the user about a concept or feature so that they can achieve basic
  competence.

  If your module has codelabs, this index should link to each of them so that
  they're populated in the table of contents. Also consider adding narrative
  instead of simply adding a bulleted list. Guide the user through the
  curriculum they should follow to become knowledgable about the module.
